## Full Transcript

Nice, yeah, yeah, yeah. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Our long form content in school, and then we're trying to distill that down into high quality short form content for the free community. so it attracts people to the premium and I saw the quality of the posts. I was like, damn, this is a, this is a good, this is a good shit. Like, like this isn't like what I was seeing from other people with their whole like content repurpose spam concept. Um, like whatever we're doing is, is, is pretty, pretty decent. And then I started to realize like the asset is us just keep running the course and the lessons because then we have like infinite good long form tips or sorry, short form tips. Like we could just repurpose, um, into for all the, so like my point is you probably already have the content library, bro, which is insane. You actually probably already do. Um, so it's like, I think a channel could be created a social media accounts for, I don't know. I don't like the idea of doing it under the brand. Um, cause I don't like brand names as much. Like they don't seem to do as well. Resonate as much as consumers either. Exactly. Exactly. But I do like the idea of us having content focused that is just drawn from the community so you don't have to spend all this time coming up with new ideas or this or that and filming or whatever. For sure. Or you could even do both or something like that. But I just have a feeling that we already have a bunch of viral content, like a bunch of money basically just sitting there. I think so too. I think so too. And then, I mean let's be real, 10 videos as a start and then you start to get feedback from the market from the data and then we run workshops on those specific topics and start to create the flywheel. But I mean now at this point let's stop talking about it and let's start executing for sure. Alright, well what are our next steps? So I think next steps are, I could probably come up with a couple of content ideas for videos based off of research and going through looking at outliers, seeing what's popular now. Collect all that, put it together with what we're seeing in VAA, and then kind of guess a little bit for what people want to see and start to script out those videos. Then I'll bring that to the table. You and I sit down and talk about it, and you give me your feedback, and you say, like, hey, yes or no, basically. I think that's a good place to start. After that, then it's just a matter of me sitting down, filming them up, getting the assets together, and start talking about it and then posting it. I think probably would want to start a channel with, like, five videos at least from the start, start posting them, and then just start feeding everything into a loop, which is channel has all of the VAA links in the bio, pushing everybody to the school community, and then providing. the info for it, right? Get those first videos up and then Two things. I think the next step after that we get a little bit of traction a little bit of interest We start talking about lead magnets and what that could look like for hey, here's your free whatever resource download Here's the top performing in voice solutions from this month or whatever it is. I don't give a shit come up with some ideas and start pushing that into The bios and the comments from the content So now people have access to some resources for free and then they're getting sucked into the loop for content Which is can't believe how good this shit is that these guys are sending as long as it's good as long as the quality is High and then we just start a flywheel like that. I Think start there I Mean I like that the core is going to be traffic yeah okay so then question here what's really popular and I'm not sure I like this but it's just what's popular are the videos of like look at this 18 year old 17 year old that is making 90k a month selling yeah that's really hot right now we can probably do something not quite like that but talking about results but not necessarily in the same viral format or with the same hook I mean not necessarily that hook okay no no I like it all I like it all I I just I'm thinking about it big picture there's a lot of value to generate with what you're talking about talking about. And it also solves another problem that I'll get to in a second. But right now we, we technically are already growing the free community. You know, it grows whatever, like 20 people per day. That's pretty good. Yeah. And on average, we can convert five to 10% of them to the premium community. Okay. Then, of the five to 10% that convert to the premium community, we can convert, we can we can convert 10%. If we were if we maximized our performance, we're basically like right in the middle, we're like, like over a long period of time so far over the last three months, it's always it's like, lower side or on the higher side. So the point is like 7.5% is the conversion rate. So with that, then of those, like another 10% will upgrade to the annual, or let's say willing to pay like $1,000, okay? So that just gives us an idea of like purchasing power a little bit, but what I believe based on my understanding of this stuff is whatever revenue we're doing, this is just like broad stroke, rule of thumb stuff, but whatever we're doing MRR side, we're doing about 10K we can match up to double with coaching. And that's from me looking at Heroot and a few other guys that have a low ticket offer and a high ticket on school. And so what that means is if we're doing 10K, we should be able to do another 10K minimum on the coaching side, I believe per month. So if we break that down into sales, we can kind of reverse engineer it and be like, okay, that would be a couple sales per month or whatever. But it gives us some perspective that I think is important because like, okay. right now, we should, there's some way to get two to four sales just with our current audience per month, I believe, is what I'm getting at. And so like, we should probably start there, we should probably start trying to, it's like, number one issue, I already tried selling a high ticket offer, by the way, in the beginning of the community, and I fell on my face, primarily because I hopped on onboarding calls with new free community members, and then would then try and sell them a $4,000 frickin' high ticket thing. The problem with that is they weren't qualified in any given way. I see what you're saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I like this, I like this. Yeah, of like, I would talk to them. You're talking about nurturing from free to paid, but then from paid to high ticket, right? And you've mentioned this a few times. Exactly. Okay. Exactly, so what we're gonna be doing is we're gonna be doing onboarding calls with the premium members, and then pitching them the coaching program. Okay, so we could start doing that. like this, like next week. Literally, absolutely. We could start coaching or pitching the coaching offer next week to our new premium members. The other opportunity is clearly there are qualified people in the free community to that aren't purchasing premium. And it's like, I'm not saying qualified for premium fucked. I'm saying qualified for high ticket coaching. So we can identify those people. Because we have intros, we have people leave intros, like we should just have one of the people on the team, you just tell me like, we need to get this done. We'll have someone on the team, go through get all the qualified people from the free community and paid community currently. And then we'll just like relentlessly will sick the sales team on them and have them have them book these calls. What if we Okay, what if we let them qualify themselves? The way that we do that is we develop an asset that's free for them to go through complete and to demonstrate their proficiency or whatever to say like dude drop a link to your project we want to fucking see it and check it out drop a link to your win here's how to land first client in 48 hours whatever it doesn't really matter if we structure it in a way that it only will allow action takers through you've qualified them you know the biggest problem with the qualification with this is do they have the money it's not the action taker thing let's I see there's gonna be more action takers than there are people with the money you want to go after the lowest common denominator so essentially we would be doing multiple steps for qualification that for action because somebody you want somebody involved but then obviously qualify the money oh I see you yeah you could do it either way you can do it either order I see what you're saying that's true that's true yeah cool whatever way you want to do it I don't care I think it's actually a matter of coming up with the asset idea giving it out for free so everybody's like holy shit this is good and then literally just take a module from the premium shit and then move it into free stuff unlock it at level to take it show us your shit and then you start to develop this group of people that are taking their own initiative to become outliers in the space right right right I like where your head is I like where your head is that but more we can do that with existing things like we have the free course or whatever and so like people go through the free course and then they message me for an onboarding gift very similar to what you're talking about but when I think to myself should we just go after those people it's it's a little bit more qualified but man I'm I can't stress the level of the problem I was running into like five to ten percent of people would be qualified and have $4,000 and want to maybe spend that $4,000 to get like higher end, whatever. So I did encounter, like I almost sold a few of the coaching already, by the way. It was just, again, this is stupid. I have to take 10 calls to get to one guy that I should then be pitching. So it was like, there's just too much wasted unqualified people. And so we just need to better qualify and then get those qualified people onto the sales calls. Yeah, that makes sense. No, that makes total sense. So, I mean, essentially you guys have solved the lead flow problem. I think one of the mid priority projects is developing another social media channel where we're talking about VAA, but I think we have lead flow solved. Now it's putting qualification steps in there to drive them through a nurturing process and get to conversions. All right, do you have to jump right now? Um, no, I'm good actually. No, I'm good. Okay. We could say that for a little bit. All good. I just got to check the messages on them rescheduling this appointment. He was wondering if you got it. Yep. Are you able to reschedule, blah, blah. Okay, so that's a pretty fast response. I'm like, that guy's not going to make it. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. So, we, our big goal should be to like close our first coaching client, basically, like that is, you know, just to extrapolate out like that is the big goal to do that we believe the fastest approach to do that is tapping into our existing community, going after qualified people in some way, and then selling them it. Then, after we're like, kind of happy that we've put in some, some groundwork into that like that process, whatever we come up with to qualify new members and. go after the existing members and that sort of thing. Like, that's a system of some sort. So we're going to be getting a few systems in place after those are whatever, 80 percent, 90 percent in place. Like, I'm sure they'll be improved a little bit in the beginning, but it's not going to be like the focused effort after that point. Then I think it makes sense to go after the social side. And because I'm going to tell you very quickly, we probably will run out of these leads very like it won't be sustainable. I don't think it will be sustainable. 10K per month. In the beginning, because the systems won't be optimized like the 10K per month is the systems being optimized, basically. What's funny is I actually do think we can do 10. We could do like a little little spurt. And that's simply because we have like backlog qualified people. Right. It's not it's not like the actual new. flow of people. And so like, yeah, I actually think it's possible we do like 10K this month or next month or whatever with the coaching program, like very quickly. But that's primarily just our past juice that we built up. Then very quickly we need to ramp up more traffic to grow. Like if we want to grow and ever get to 15K per month, like we're gonna need more traffic. Like it's that simple. So anyways, I just wanted to lay out that and my thoughts there. Okay. So. So. Biggest problem was you had some people in the pool that were good, qualified leads, but it took a long time to sift through and identify who those were. Basically 10 calls. and it was hard to identify who had the money. Fair? I was just scheduling calls with everyone. And then it turns out for every 10 calls, like one guy would have the money. I said, and it took me a second to realize that was even a problem. I was just like, oh, 10 calls, I'm gonna fucking 20% close rate, 30% close rate. Like, no, no, no, no, no. 20 to 30% close rate of qualified, like people you actually pitch. That makes sense. But when you're over here taking 10 calls. Yeah, for sure. And there's no one qualified guy. So it just, it took me a lot of calls to realize that was even happening. Okay, I see what you're saying. I think it will be there. I think just the nature of the funnel right now is a lot of them would be unqualified. But what I will say is, identifying the difference makers for those high ticket clients, like what are they looking for when they wanna start their agency? information for voice AI development? What resources do they want? One of the craziest thing, a lot of them were willing to pay the 4k for the white label dev team access, they're willing to pay high ticket to then just have us do their development and bring us leads. And I'm like, Oh, like, dude, I was like, losing my mind. Because I was like, dude, this is this is some cash printing machine I've never fucking heard of in my life. But but I just I wasn't able to, to get you know, the high ticket offer going. Interesting. I was one of the biggest things they wanted. Yeah, it was like, just be my dad. Holy stupid idea, stupid idea. How hard would it be to take all the apprentices, train them up as your in house devs? No, keep them separate subcontractors to your in house dev that they get off flow, overflow from all the leads you bring in from a white label strategy now that is that I've been building up to okay you have it yes yes okay that's it I like it I like it a lot because that sounds extremely lucrative like crazy although there's all the team management shit that you have to deal with obviously but okay interesting hey give me one second let me call this guy back go for it you If you have any questions or comments, please leave them in the comments section. I will try my best to answer as many as possible. If you have any questions or comments, please leave them in the comments section. If you have any questions or comments, please leave them in the comments section. I actually I have an opening I have an opening I'll have to go in like five minutes by the way but but like thankfully I can actually get these errands knocked out this this guy this works sweet but anyways okay so I think that changes our next steps a little bit focusing less on content and then focusing on cleaning up the funnel from free to paid inside a school well let me simplify something for you like I'm I'm gonna be continuously optimizing that funnel and also I'm sure you will see things that you're like hey let's let's improve this but I think it's a little bit solved because what we're doing right now is remember we got Gabe who's kind of like think of him as sales sales master sales guru and so it's like he's training Arian so we're getting the the benefit of Gabe without Gabe spending all his damn time every all day And Arien is I don't know if you've heard about it. He's like 15. Yeah Okay, cool cool cool, so anyways He's kind of doing a lot of the grunt work so one of the things he's doing is every new member is He's trying to get them on to an onboarding call for the free community. So we have that in place We just started getting that in place. Then he's doing the same thing with the premium community guys I believe that Just that as the core Main like point in the funnel like decision points it as long as we optimize for free onboarding calls and free or sorry premium onboarding calls and Everything flows to that then it'll all work out. And so like we're talking me and you are talking about funnels and stuff It's like well those funnels should just drive to that onboarding call like the onboarding call is the lead magnet. It is the thing. And then from there, either like, who cares? Arian doesn't him talking to qualified people actually isn't the problem. We could waste his time. I just didn't like wasting my time. I really annoyed me. I couldn't see the end of it. I was like, bro, this is horrible. But um, but the main point is like, he just needs to have a way to qualify them when he's on that call. It's like, look, if they're not qualified, cool, I give you a little bit of value. We're good. Okay, and then we're done. But if he is qualified, because Arian asked the right whatever question determined the guy has a budget, and actually wants coaching, potentially, okay, aren't aren't pitching that or scheduling another call with with us to then like in the beginning, actually, that probably makes sense. We have him almost do like a discovery call. It's not framed as that in any way, but he's kind of doing that to make sure they're qualified, then then it comes to us. That actually would be the best flow in the beginning, I think. So it's like he is the guy sifting through to see if they're qualified, then it comes to us, and we just take qualified calls, we close them. That's what I have in mind. So I know you're trying to improve it here and there, and I'm just like, I think it's already in place. The main things right now are to make it so everything leads to that onboarding call. For example, our email sequence in GoHighLevel right now is not set up to lead to the onboarding call. We can do like DM- Who's in charge of all that? Is there somebody that's managing that stuff? Me. Is it you? Okay. Me. Okay. Not well, not like, yeah. Sure. But, so the email sequence needs to be updated. Basically all the things that drive to onboarding need to be updated. So that's on my to-do list. I will get that knocked out, and then it will be as good as it is. is done, and then from there, I'm sure you will see some improvements, but it'll be as easy as you just saying like, hey, let's change this, let's do this, and then it's like, well, have someone do that. It's not gonna be like this whole effort, though, to get the funnel going. I think it's already pretty much there. Okay, that makes sense. And then the other piece, so there's a lot. We're covering so much, man, which I actually love that you can keep up. So we got acquisition we just talked about, and then we talked about sales, basically. There's this other part I've been thinking the whole time I want to include you on immediately, which is the fulfillment, which is basically, I wanna bring you onto the coaching calls. And so, obviously, right now, it's just a single weekly call. It's not a big deal. But I would like to improve on it over time. I want you to think from the frame once you start helping with fulfillment. How do I actually make this guy fricking successful? Yeah, we need to worry. It's not about like, these systems, this these lessons, like what we can teach this guy, like, that's cool. But no, no, just step back and actually think to yourself, why is this guy failing? Like, what is going on here? And I suspect one of the powerful things we could do is literally just check in with them once or twice per week ourselves. That would be huge. It takes a couple minutes. And yet has such an impact if you had your, your mentor, your coach reaching out to you and checking in on you. But I have a I have a business coach Coogan. He's actually in our community, which by the way, he just joined as a partner. He was going to join us. He just joined as a partner to Iman Godsey's ex CEO Paul Daly. Oh, nice. Yeah, the daily daily bread stuff. Yeah, so so I love what he's doing right now. Coogan is my buddy. He's a really good friend of mine. He's been my business coach for a couple of years now, bro. And he like, scaled some startup to 100 million per year. And then he had his own agency at 100 k per month. And then he launched a coaching offer when I met him. And he did 100 he was doing 180 k a month like, like it was nothing. I'm like, Who is this guy was and he's like a year older than me. I'm like, geez. So anyways, he he did, because we're genuine friends. And we actually care about each other now. Like we check in on each other. Like, hey, how's it going with Paul? And like, he gave me some long ass update today. He's like, he's brutal in these ways. But he moves really fast and efficient. And it's like, that's so simple, that I did that little check in. But that meant a lot to him. Yeah, you know, so, you know, I get that we do that because we're friends. But obviously, if you had that at a, at a coaching student level, that would be very impactful, too. So I agree. with that. Okay. Um, so anyways, so it sounds like we did talk about it in multiple buckets, which was the information bucket, the, uh, coaching and accountability bucket. And then the marketing side, uh, we kind of covered the marketing side, the acquisition stuff information. Um, I think kind of good ish. Right. We still, we still probably have like I'm like anti-info when it comes to this coaching off in the beginning a little bit. Yeah. Structuring this coaching and how we would achieve accountability I think is, is a really good, um, target right now. This is what it sounds like to me. What does it look like? Like exactly what you're talking about. Weekly check-ins on private channels with all of the students. How do we drive success for each individual? How do we keep them on track? Keep them on plan. So looking at this from the fulfillment aspect, I think is another, it'll be a whole thing. I know. Right. No, I get you. I get you. Do we take a first pass at it right now to kind of structure it and start testing a fast iteration of like first look? I think I have, like, you'll notice, like, I kind of have prelim stuff set up for a lot of this. So like, I think, you know, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not So I think first, just get you, get you in there. And there are a couple improvements that I've, I've hinted at. Like, I really think a monthly motivation call with someone who's successful, like, like we kind of did with Zach. I think that was so amazing. I would love to almost do that every week. I just think it's impractical to try and get a bad-ass motivational speaker every fucking week. Yeah. That's not practical. Right. So I think, you know, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not trying to be a bad-ass motivational speaker every fucking week. Yeah. That's not practical. Right. So, so we could do that monthly. I think that will change. the game on on it, honestly. And then I think the additional check ins will be super valuable. I don't want to sit here and add all these features, though. I'm just thinking like what, what is actually going to move the needle in a way that we're going to look back and be thankful that we did that. And it was very low. Like it was already that low risk, high reward. It's very clear that that that's how it should go with with that feature. Yeah, I like that. So for me, I'm good with just just those. Like we don't need to expand on too much. I just want to get you involved. I just want to get you like taking those weekly calls and thinking about the five students and stuff like that. So because more things will occur to you over time. Okay. That works. Cool. Cool. All right. I gotta I gotta jump. Yeah, we're good from here. All right. Great discussion, man. We'll keep cracking away and talk to you soon. For sure. Do me a favor and send an agreement over whenever you get a chance. Yes, sir. Okay. I appreciate it, Terrell. Dude, I'm fucking fired up. Let's go. Let's go, bro. All right. I'll catch you. Okay.  you
