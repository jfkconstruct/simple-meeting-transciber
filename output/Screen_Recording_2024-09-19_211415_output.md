## Full Transcript

Hey, I just wanted to film real quick on the process for replacing the backgrounds. So if you go over here to file, wrong one, sorry. Click on the drawings, go here to import PDF, replace the backgrounds, and it'll give you a list of all the drawings right here. You'll select whatever the PDF that you're going to use to replace these drawings with. I think let's try this one. This is just for example, this isn't the actual PDF, but you'll use the ones that I gave you. Wait for it to load, depending on the size of the PDF. And then each drawing, you'll have to match the new one with the old one. So you would go and check the PDF and say, I think I told you 7, 8, 9, and 10. So it should, it should be 7, 8, 9, and 10, but you got to double check, make sure that they match. Ah, one more thing. Before you do that. select auto select replacements so that it doesn't do all the pages at once. So I have to manually select 7, then 8, then 9 and 10. That's a brief look. You'll hit OK. It'll replace the backgrounds and then it should come up with something like this. These will be completely different, obviously, so that it will look different. It should line up. But there will also be these red clouds that show up for you around the changes. And so that will help you to review the area just to make sure that they're correct. Just go through each area and see if there's massive changes. And that should be it. Thanks.
