## Summary

The speaker offers a tutorial on replacing backgrounds in drawing software, highlighting the importance of matching new and old drawings (pages 7-10). They recommend using "auto select replacements" for efficiency and suggest manually selecting each page. After background replacements, red clouds indicate changed areas for easier review. The tutorial ends with a thank you.

## Next Steps

### Final Action Plan for Background Replacement

1. **Prepare PDFs**: Gather PDF files for drawings 7, 8, 9, and 10.

2. **Import PDFs**:
   - Open the software and access "File" > "Import PDF."
   - Select the background replacement option.

3. **Select Correct PDF**: Choose the applicable PDF file for each drawing.

4. **Enable Auto Select**: Ensure the "auto select replacements" option is checked.

5. **Match Drawings**:
   - Manually pair new backgrounds with the correct old ones (7, 8, 9, and 10).
   - Verify each match for accuracy against the PDFs.

6. **Execute Replacement**: Click "OK" or the confirmation button to apply the background replacements.

7. **Review Changes**:
   - Examine drawings with red clouds for modifications.
   - Identify any areas needing further adjustments or attention.

8. **Finalize and Save**: Confirm all matches, finalize changes, and save your work.

9. **Document Process**: Note any challenges or important insights for future reference.

10. **Communicate Completion**: Inform your team or supervisor about the task completion.

By implementing these steps, you will effectively replace the drawing backgrounds.

## Full Transcript

Hey, I just wanted to film real quick on the process for replacing the backgrounds. So if you go over here to file, wrong one, sorry. Click on the drawings, go here to import PDF, replace the backgrounds, and it'll give you a list of all the drawings right here. You'll select whatever the PDF that you're going to use to replace these drawings with. I think let's try this one. This is just for example, this isn't the actual PDF, but you'll use the ones that I gave you. Wait for it to load, depending on the size of the PDF. And then each drawing, you'll have to match the new one with the old one. So you would go and check the PDF and say, I think I told you 7, 8, 9, and 10. So it should, it should be 7, 8, 9, and 10, but you got to double check, make sure that they match. Ah, one more thing. Before you do that. select auto select replacements so that it doesn't do all the pages at once. So I have to manually select 7, then 8, then 9 and 10. That's a brief look. You'll hit OK. It'll replace the backgrounds and then it should come up with something like this. These will be completely different, obviously, so that it will look different. It should line up. But there will also be these red clouds that show up for you around the changes. And so that will help you to review the area just to make sure that they're correct. Just go through each area and see if there's massive changes. And that should be it. Thanks.
